# Image Analysis of Skin Lesion: Melanoma

## Project Description

A dermatologist in your city asks if you can investigate whether some characteristics of skin lesions can be reliably measured with a smartphone app. The characteristics the dermatologist is especially interested in are: asymmetry, border and color. Your goal is first to measure two or more of these characteristics in a set of skin lesion images.
Then you should try to assess how good the measurements are, for example, by predicting the diagnosis of the skin lesions based on these features.
